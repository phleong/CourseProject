Project for Getting and Cleaning Data

This folder contains the following two files:
* run_script.r
 * This is the R script used to clean the data collected from the accelerometers of the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. The dataset is found on https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
 * The output of the script is a file called "new_data.txt" that contains the average values of the mean and standard deviation of the different types of measurements available in the original dataset (both training and test). 
 * For each type of measurement, the dataset contains the average data from each of 30 subjects doing each of 6 different activities.
* codebook.md
 * This file contains the details of the manipulations done in the run_script.r to clean the original dataset and the information of the variables generated when running run_script.r.
